I created this app using nextjs 14.0.3

This app uses the api provided by the developers from [Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com)  
You can enter in your latitude and longitutde get locate the closest arcade relative to your position

Alternatively, you can click the "Near Me" button to have your geolocation used
to find the nearest arcade

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
